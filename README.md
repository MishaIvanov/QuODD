###Quantum Optics Dynamic Dashboard

The Quantum Optics Dynamic Dashboard is a Mathematica package to aid in the visualization of the complex-valued trajectories that arise in the theory of optical tunnelling - i.e., the ionization of atoms by strong, low-frequency laser fields by means of the tunnel effect.

To get the dashboard, download the ZIP file from the bar on the right and unpack its contents onto a folder. To view the Dashboard, open `Quantum Optics Dynamic Dashboard.nb` in Mathematica and evaluate the first cell to initialize the notebook.

The Dashboard framework consists of three packages: `QuODD`, which contains the functions that make the Dashboard, and two support packages: `EPToolbox` for general functions, and `ARMSupport` for functions relating to the Analytical *R*-Matrix theory. These three packages are formally contained in the `.m` files, but they are built from, and better documented in, the corresponding `.nb` files.
